INTRODUCTION

Libraries are the source of knowledge and any student would say that the importance of a library in their life is tremendously significant. Thus, a library management system which would efficiently assist both students and faculty, is imperative in every educational organization.
Our project – the library management system – offers the required solution. This library management system project is designed using C++ and it makes use of classes and objects. The project is well equipped to handle all the functions of the library. It helps the administration in maintaining the database of all the new books and the books that are borrowed by the members along with necessary details like the day of return, fine accumulated etc. It is a system in which both the administration and the student can access the components related to them through their respective passwords. The administration can create, display, modify the student details. They can also keep a track of all the books in the library. The students can borrow and view the books that are present in the library.
This project is user friendly. At each step, the user is presented with a menu of options and they can select which one they would like to proceed with. The project also takes in consideration the need for security and thus it provides a login system for staff and student alike. All the changes in library database is reflected in the corresponding files.
